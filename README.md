Overview
========

IPMA is the acronym for Portuguese Institute of the Sea and the Atmosphere. This project uses two API's made available by this institute, where we have data from atmospheric sensors installed throughout mainland Portugal and Islands (Azores and Madeira).

These data are stored in an instance of Postgres (running on docker), as well as Astronomer to orchestrate the data collection.
